## Quill Improver: AI-powered Code Quality Checker

**Quill Improver** assists developers in writing cleaner and more maintainable code by leveraging the power of AI and a customizable knowledge base.

### Purpose

Quill Improver helps developers:

- **Enhance code quality:** Identify potential issues like complexity violations, style inconsistencies, and other areas for improvement based on your knowledge base.
- **Write code for maintainability:** By focusing on best practices and clear structure, Quill Improver guides you towards writing code that's easier to understand and modify in the future.
- **Boost development efficiency:** Automated suggestions expedite the review process and highlight areas that might need attention, saving you valuable development time.

### Installation

**Prerequisites:**

- Python 3.x
- `pip` package installer

**Steps:**

1. Clone this repository or download the project files.
2. Open a terminal in the project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

### Usage

1. **Create a knowledge base:** Build a text file named `code_quality_knowledge.txt` in the project directory. Each line should follow the format:

   ```
   Code Snippet : Improvement Comment
   ```

   - Replace `Code Snippet` with an example of code that demonstrates the potential issue.
   - Replace `Improvement Comment` with a suggestion for improvement or best practice related to the code snippet.

2. Run the application using:

   ```bash
   python main.py -c "your_code_here" -k "code_quality_knowledge.txt"
   ```

   - Replace `"your_code_here"` with the code you want to analyze (either as a string or the path to a file containing the code).
   - Replace `"code_quality_knowledge.txt"` with the actual filename of your knowledge base file if it's named differently.

3. The script will analyze the provided code and display findings or a message indicating well-structured code if no issues are detected.

**Note:** This is a basic implementation. For more advanced analysis, consider expanding the knowledge base and potential checks.
